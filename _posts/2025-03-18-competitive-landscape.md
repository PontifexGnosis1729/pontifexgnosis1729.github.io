### What is a System?

Seth Godin: Systems are invisible and they hide themselves because they don’t want people to see who’s operating things. They invent culture to defend themselves. Systems, the most famous one is the Solar System. There’s this invisible gravity. The Earth doesn’t go around the sun because it wants, it goes around the sun because gravity makes that its easiest path.

If you grew up in the United States to middle-class parents, you’ll be under pressure from the time you’re five years old to get good grades. Why do I need to get good grades? So you can get into a famous college, but you’re not supposed to call it a famous college. You’re supposed to call it a good college. And that system with tuition and tenure, and student debt and football teams, and cheerleaders, and college tours, and the sticker on the back of a car, and the SATs, all of it is just taken for granted as normal.

And so Donella Meadows has done brilliant writing before she passed way too early about all the dynamics of systems, systems in our world, systems that we want to build. So when we see a system under stress, then we can see the system, then we can see the climate when temperatures start to rise. But before the temperature started to rise, when the climate was normal, no one paid attention to it because the system, the thing that keeps it going was sort of invisible. So if you’re going to start any enterprise, a little plumbing business, a giant internet company, if you’re going to run for office, you should be able to see and name the elements of the system. Where is there gravity? What is seen as normal? And there’s pushback if you don’t do it.

Tim Ferriss: And we can linger on this one for a bit because the next one is time. So I feel like we should take our time plus it’s long form. So could you give an example on a smaller scale of a, you mentioned plumbing doesn’t need to be plumbing, but a solopreneur or a very, very small startup, two to four employees, and how they might start to ask questions around systems to identify the systems that are at work. Because for instance, in my life, I’m good at identifying what is normal, like what are the unquestioned assumptions? I’m good at that, but that seems like I’m holding the tail of the elephant, like one of the blind men in the parable. I’ve got a piece of it, but it’s not the whole elephant, clearly.

Seth Godin: So let’s say you’re going to build a small business that supports medium-sized businesses with their Google Workspace. So you’re a couple nerds and you’re going to be the person who helps people set up their Google Drive, and across the organization, reasonably secure for a company with a hundred employees.

Because you’re in there in the factory seeing how things are made, it’s very tempting to imagine that everyone you’re serving wants what you want, and that you think your customer is the person who’s buying stuff from you, and what they need is a tech solution. None of these things are true, that the system of a company with a hundred people is, it’s probably not the CEO’s job to set this thing up. So it’s someone else’s job. There’s a system, a hierarchy of jobs. What does that person want? It’s not their money, so lowering your price to get new customers is not going to help you get new customers, that in fact, what that person wants is a story to tell their boss, a story of why did I pick these people, and even better a story of if it fails, why they are not going to be in trouble.

And so when we show up at an organization to tell our story to that system, we have to do it understanding how do they buy everything else? What do they measure? What would happen to us if we’re bigger than the other people bidding or smaller than the other people bidding? All of these things go into how the system works, the same way the admissions office at the famous college doesn’t always pick the people with the highest SAT scores, because there’s this complicated mechanism at play that is historical to feed and maintain the system.

And so in the case of this Google Workspace thing, let’s say you decide to close on Thanksgiving Day and you’ve just got a message on your voicemail, “We’re closed on Thanksgiving Day. Leave a message, we’ll call you back tomorrow.” That seems normal, unless what got you into the system was an unbreakable promise that you will never get in trouble because we will always answer the phone. That decision, that tactical decision has to be driven by what you seek to stand for, but that’s only going to happen if you see the system of what this company your client does, and what stories do they tell themselves, right?

And Hollywood is a system and the senior prom is a system. And there are all these factors that go into all of them, subtle signals that people are sending to each other. And if you’re going to make a living taking money from people to solve their problems, it has to be to help them dance with the system that they’re part of.
