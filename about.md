Generative AI is rapidly accelerating the rate of web content generation, and soon, AI agents will not just rephrase old ideas, but will drive the cutting edge frontier of new research.
As the volume of specialized machine knowledge expands exponentially, human comprehension remains limited.
This dynamic of AI research agents producing more and more specialized knowledge, and human minds limited in our speed of understanding this specialized knowledge will create a gap between man and machine knowledge.
Control of this gap will be of great strategic importance.

We are building AI tools to control the flow of knowledge across this gap, transforming dense, esoteric machine knowledge into comprehensible human understanding.
By leveraging AI to illuminate the obscure, we aim to make the frontier of knowledge available to allâ€”so that no breakthrough remains locked away.
